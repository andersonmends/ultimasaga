# Ultima SaGa

This is a project for an RPG game, inspired by childhood games such as: Final Fantasy , Chrono Trigger, Breath of Fire, Dragon Quest, Xenogears, etc. This project that started in RPG Maker 2000 and then was ported to RPG Maker 2003, and then RPG Marker XP. Despite a framework with ready-made assets, it is possible to program in core via ruby script, where I had to create adapt and create some routines. This project started as a child's dream and hobby, at my 15 years old, and I hope to continue today. Despite having lost the XP version, I managed to recover the 2003 version, which reminds me of some details, but the basic idea of the design was always in my mind.
